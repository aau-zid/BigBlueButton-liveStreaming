* docker-compose up -d
* docker-compose down 

### Chat feedback
to use the user feedback via chat injection you will have to setup a website wehre the user can write comments and send them to your meeting.
In the examples folder, there are two files you can use as starting point:

* player_and_chat.php
place this in a public webpage or create a similar webform that will be send to the processing php file sendChatMessage.php

* sendChatMessage.php
this file must be reachable by the webform and has to have access to the redis database you configured in your docker-compose file.

## Known Limitations
* the streamer does not reconnect, if the connection to BigBlueButton gets lost
* when using breakoutrooms, the streamer will show the popup of the invitation and not be able to get back to the conference
